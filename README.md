# git-session

After a sucessful session of learning, interaction and real time activities, now it's time to revise, recap or learn from the start if you missed it.

In this repo you'll find "GIT SESSION.docx" containing an excerpt of what all was discussed along with the presentation used.
You will also find a book meant for detailed and advanced git, for anybody who wishes to step further.

The task for the session was to create a pull request for this repository after adding a file of your name.
The task is still active for anybody who wishes to mark thier "Attendance".
